          👋 Hi, I’m Dwarkesh. I'm trying to make a platform that helps people
          identify problems and create new ideas. There is nothing more helpful
          to this mission than your feedback. Thank you! 🙏
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          📝 To give feedback, please create or solve a problem with the tag
          "popperplay".
        </Typography>
        {/* <Typography variant="body1"  align="center" gutterBottom >
          PopperPlay is my conjecture about how we can create a platform for
          knowledge creation. But it contains many errors. I desperately need
          your help in order to identify and correct them.
        </Typography> */}
        <Typography variant="h6" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          I want to see if problems with PopperPlay can be solved using
          PopperPlay. This way, the entire platform can contribute and improve
          ideas.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h6" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          Every problem, comment, and suggestion you have is tremendously
          helpful at this early stage. Everything is subject to improvement:
          platform structure, features, philosophy, user interfaces.
