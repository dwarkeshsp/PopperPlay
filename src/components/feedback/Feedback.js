          👋 Hi, I’m Dwarkesh. I'm trying to make a platform for fun and open
          problem solving. There is nothing more useful to this mission than
          your feedback. Thank you for your help! 🙏

          📝 To give feedback, please create or solve a problem with the tag
          "popperplay".

          PopperPlay is my conjecture about how we can create a platform for
          knowledge creation. But it contains many errors. I desperately need
          your help in order to identify and correct them.
        </Typography> */}
        <Typography variant="h6" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          I'm hoping that problems with PopperPlay will be solved using
          PopperPlay. This way, the entire platform can contribute and improve
          ideas.

          Every problem, comment, and suggestion you have is tremendously
          helpful at this early stage. Everything is subject to improvement:
          Platform structure, features, bugs, philosophy, user interfaces.
