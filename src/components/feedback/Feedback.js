          üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Dwarkesh. I'm trying to make a platform for fun and open
          problem solving. There is nothing more useful to this mission than
          your feedback. Thank you for your help! üôè
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          To give feedback, please create or solve a problem with the tag
          "popperplay".
        </Typography>
        {/* <Typography variant="body1"  align="center" gutterBottom >
          PopperPlay is my conjecture about how we can create a platform for
          knowledge creation. But it contains many errors. I desperately need
          your help in order to identify and correct them.
        </Typography> */}
        <Typography variant="h6" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          I'm hoping that problems with PopperPlay will be solved using
          PopperPlay. This way, the entire platform can contribute and improve
          ideas.

        <Typography variant="h6" align="center" gutterBottom paragraph>
          Every problem, comment, and suggestion you have is tremendously
          helpful at this early stage. All is subject to improvement: Platform
          structure, features, bugs, philosophy, user interfaces.
