          PopperPlay is my conjecture about how we can create a platform for
          knowledge creation. But it contains many errors. I desperately need
          your help in order to identify and correct them.

          Platform structure, feature requests, bugs, philosophy, user
          interfaces - I desperately need your help with all of these. Ideally,
          problems with PopperPlay will be solved using PopperPlay. This way,
          the entire platform can contribute and improve solutions.
