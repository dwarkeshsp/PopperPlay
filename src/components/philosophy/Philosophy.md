#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Dwarkesh. I'm trying to make a platform that helps people solve problems and create new ideas.

## Problem Solving

I had a problem. I wanted to find and solve interesting problems, but there was no fun and easy way to do this.

As a college student, I realized that not only was I was I not solving problems, I wasn't even learning how to solve problems. Instead, I was learning how to pretend like I was solving an interesting problem creatively while being neither creative nor interested.

How much fun it would be to identify where existing explanations were inadequate and create new ones! This is what education should be, I thought: not the dull replication of recieved dogma but the fun and open creation of new ideas. This is what life is. Problems arise when ideas are in conflict with each other, and as Karl Popper stated, "All life is problem solving." How much progress we could make if problem solving was freed from the gatekeeping, bureaucracy, and inertia that currently impinges on it!

## No Ads or Paywalls

Ads and paywalls are bad solutions to the problem of monetization. I think it's wrong to make people pay to receive or create knowledge. As a college student, I probably wouldn't be able to afford PopperPlay myself if it was paywalled.

Advertisements are perhaps even worse. They create an incentive to optimize for click-bait and distraction, and they destroy the user experience (who, after all, hasn't cringed when an article they were reading was replaced with popups and banners)

But as PopperPlay grows, I will need money and to pay for servers and to support the time I am spending in building features and improving the site. I need your ideas about [how I should monetize](https://popperplay.com/problem/Ri7rf6GspvuCuuVL1274).

## Peer to Peer Donations

I am currently considering something like the Patreon model, where people can donate to those they think are solving interesting problems, and PopperPlay takes a percentage of each transaction. We can avoid ads and paywalls, and PopperPlay's incentives would align with the benefit of problem solvers.

### Escape

Most importantly, we can create an escape from existing sense-making institution. People will be able to make money simply by creating knowledge. Creativity and fun no longer need to be shackled by problems like day jobs, gatekeeping, and bureaucracy.

## Popper's Criterion

> SOCRATES: I see. I have no need to trust the source if the argument itself is persuasive. And no way of using any source unless I also have a persuasive argument.
>
> David Deutsch, from _A Dream of Socrates_ in _The Beginning of Infinity_ [^1]

News, academia, and social media are in crisis. They are turning dogmatic, dishonest, and tribal. The source of this trouble is that we have been using the wrong criterion to judge institutions which help create knowledge. The prevailing approach focuses on sources, asking, "Who should we trust?" [^2]

This question is based on the same mistakes as the prevailing question in political philosophy, "Who should rule?". The philosopher Karl Popper pointed out that that since all rulers are fallible, and since they will all make mistakes, we will never find the perfect ruler who, once appointed, will dissolve problems once and for all. Similarly, there is no source of information which is free from error and bias. [^3]

When we ask, "Who should we trust?", we are expecting explanationless progress. We are trying to predict future success from raw data like the qualifications and track record of news organizations and academic journals. But this is not an explanation for why we should expect progress to continue.

The only rational way to create progress is to satisfy Popper's criterion. The criterion which Karl Popper created to judge political institutions is equally applicable to platforms of knowledge creation: _Does the system facilitate the correction of errors and the creation of new ideas using reason and persuasion?_

Instead of seeking higher authorities of knowledge, we can build a platform which creates progress by encouraging problem solving, idea generation, and the criticism of prevailing conjectures. Furthermore, the platform must be subject to error correction so that people can improve the structure of problem solving itself.

## Error Correction

PopperPlay is inspired by the philosophy of critical rationalism, but countless errors have been made in instantiating this theory. These errors will be found in the layout and structure of the website, in missing features, in the algorithms for featuring problems and conjectures (once I build them), and even in the philosophy you are reading right now. These problems cannot be solved unless they are accessible by all to identify and conjectures solutions upon. That is why PopperPlay is completely open source. I desperately need your [feedback](https://popperplay.com/feedback) in order to make this website a more fun and open forum for the creation of new ideas and correction of errors.

[^1]: I realize the irony of using a source to make this point. I'm not appealing to authority, only to good writing.
[^2]: From this are derived further bad questions like, "How do we ensure that our journalistic and academic classes are responsible and informed?", "Who should be allowed to participate in the process of sense making?", and "How should the gatekeepers be educated?"
[^3]: If we believe that we found such a source, then we become prone to believe incredulous claims which could not survive open criticism. Furthermore, there is no rational way to resolve disputes between sources claiming to justify their own credibility. Instead, disagreements must be settled by fallacious appeals to authority (failing that, violence).
