#### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Dwarkesh. I built PopperPlay in order to help people identify and solve problems. Here's why.

_Many of following ideas are inspired by David Deutsch and Karl Popper. They are given full credit and gratitude._

## Problem Solving

> All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.
>
> David Deutsch

Where a conscious being suffers or dies, where a truth about the universe remains unknown, where we fail to explore, create, and understand - the cause is that we have lack the knowledge to solve some problem. Given this truth, our entire civilization should be dedicated to helping people solve problems. Every human being has the capacity to create knowledge, and we should be doing everything we possibly can to utilize their creativity and problem-solving. 

(Not clear)

But tragically, this is not so. Instead of empowering the entire repertoire of human thought, we only give a select few the resources, information, and platform to create knowledge. This is in and of itself a severe problem, because it is handicapping the solution of all other problems.

PopperPlay is the ever-improving solution. Here, anyone can identify where prevailing conjectures are inadequate. Anyone can create a tentative assertion which solves the problem. Anyone can criticize and improve the conjectures others have made. People can 

## A Portal

> The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say â€˜It is our duty to remain optimists,â€™ this includes not only the openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the future holds in store. Thus it is our duty, not to prophesy evil but, rather, to fight for a better world.

> Karl Popper, _The Myth of the Framework_

Eric Weinstein has explained the inspiring meaning of a [portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb_yvBNLjNk) - an idea, a place, an experience that helps us escape our hum-drum lives and shows us how brilliantly interesting the world is. I conjecture that what one feels upon entering a portal is optimism. A person is introduced to a beautiful and novel problem and realizes that they can solve it.

In my own quest for portals, I found no fun and open way to identify and solve problems. [^1] So I built PopperPlay. I want to make it easy for myself and others to experience the freedom and joy of problem solving. ...

(Incorrect? Grammarly)

How much fun it would be to identify where existing explanations were inadequate and create new ones! How much progress could be unleashed if problem solving was freed from the gatekeeping, bureaucracy, and inertia that currently impinges on it!

## Popper's Criterion

> The question about the sources of our knowledge ... has always been asked in the spirit of: â€˜What are the best sources of our knowledge - the most reliable ones, those which will not lead us into error, and those to which
> we can and must turn, in case of doubt, as the last court of appeal?â€™ I propose to assume, instead, that no such ideal sources exist - no more than ideal rulers - and that all â€˜sourcesâ€™ are liable to lead us into error at times. And I propose to replace, therefore, the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?
>
> Karl Popper, *Knowledge without Authority* [^1]

News, academia, and social media are in crisis. They are turning dogmatic, dishonest, and tribal. The source of this trouble is that we have been using the wrong criterion to judge institutions which help create knowledge. The prevailing approach focuses on sources, asking, "Who should we trust?" [^2]

This question is based on the same mistakes as the prevailing question in political philosophy, "Who should rule?". The philosopher Karl Popper pointed out that that since all rulers are fallible, and since they will all make mistakes, we will never find the perfect ruler who, once appointed, will dissolve problems once and for all. Similarly, there is no source of information which is free from error and bias. If we believe that we found such a source, then we become prone to believe incredulous claims which could not survive open criticism. Furthermore, there is no rational way to resolve disputes between sources claiming to justify their own credibility. Instead, disagreements must be settled by irrational appeals to authority. Failing that, violence must be used to suppress those that reject the authoritative truth.

When we ask, "Who should we trust?", we are expecting explanationless progress. We are trying to predict future success from raw data like the qualifications and track record of news organizations and academic journals. But this is not an explanation for why we should expect progress to continue without any error correction.

The only rational way to create progress is to satisfy Popper's criterion. The criterion which Karl Popper created to judge political institutions is equally applicable to platforms of knowledge creation: _Does the system facilitate the correction of errors and the creation of new ideas?_

Instead of seeking higher authorities of knowledge, we can allow people to identify problems with prevailing explanations, conjecture solutions upon them, and then criticize these tentative guesses. Only in this way can we correct errors, 

These new explanations will generate even more interesting problems, and we will solve them as well.

build a platform which creates knowledge by encouraging problem solving, idea generation, and the criticism of prevailing conjectures. And we can subject our platform to error correction so that we can improve the structure of problem solving itself.

## Error Correction

PopperPlay is inspired by the philosophy of critical rationalism, but countless errors have been made in instantiating this theory. These errors will be found in the layout and structure of the website, in missing features, in the algorithms for featuring problems and conjectures (once I build them), and even in the philosophy you are reading right now. These problems cannot be solved unless they are accessible by all to identify and conjecture solutions upon. That is why **PopperPlay is completely open source**. I need your [feedback](https://popperplay.com/feedback) in order to make this website a more fun and open forum for the creation of new ideas and correction of errors.

## No Ads or Paywalls

Ads and paywalls are bad solutions to the problem of monetization. I think it's wrong to make people pay to receive or create knowledge. As a college student, I probably wouldn't be able to afford PopperPlay myself if it was paywalled.

Advertisements are perhaps even worse. They create an incentive to optimize for click-bait and distraction, and they destroy the user experience (who, after all, hasn't cringed when an article they were reading was replaced with popups and banners)

But as PopperPlay grows, I will need money and to pay for servers and to support the time I am spending in building features and improving the site. I need your ideas about [how I should monetize](https://popperplay.com/problem/Ri7rf6GspvuCuuVL1274).

## Peer to Peer Donations

Here's what I'm considering. People can donate to those they think are solving interesting problems, and PopperPlay takes a percentage of each donation. We can avoid ads and paywalls, and PopperPlay's incentives would align with the benefit of problem solvers.

Most importantly, we can help people escape from existing channels. People will be able to sustain a life of creating knowledge. Creativity and fun no longer need to be shackled by problems like day jobs, gatekeeping, and bureaucracy.



[^1]: As a college student, I realized that not only was I was I not solving problems, I wasn't even learning how to solve problems. Instead, I was learning how to pretend like I was solving an interesting problem creatively while being neither creative nor interested.
[^1]: I realize the irony of using a source to make this point. I'm not appealing to authority, only to good writing.
[^2]: From this are derived further bad questions like, "How do we ensure that our journalistic and academic classes are responsible and informed?", "Who should be allowed to participate in the process of sense making?", and "How should the gatekeepers be educated?"
