#### PopperPlay helps people identify and solve problems.

## Problem Solving

> All evils are caused by insufficient knowledge.
>
> David Deutsch

Where a conscious being suffers or dies, where a truth about the universe remains unknown, where we fail to explore, create, and understand - the cause is that we have not solved some problem. Given this truth, our entire civilization should be dedicated to helping people solve problems. Since all human beings have the capacity to create knowledge, society should be milking every ounce of creativity and problem-solving from every person alive.

But tragically, this is not so. Instead of exploiting the entire repertoire of human thought, we give only a select few the resources, information, and platform to identify and solve problems. This is a severe problem, because it is handicapping the solution of all other problems.

PopperPlay attempts to solve it.

## A Portal

> The possibilities that lie in the future are infinite. When I say ‘It is our duty to remain optimists,’ this includes not only the openness of the future but also that which all of us contribute to it by everything we do: we are all responsible for what the future holds in store. Thus it is our duty, not to prophesy evil but, rather, to fight for a better world.
>
> Karl Popper, _The Myth of the Framework_

Eric Weinstein has explained the inspiring meaning of a [portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb_yvBNLjNk) - an idea, a place, an experience that helps us escape our hum-drum lives and shows us how brilliantly interesting the world is. I conjecture that what one feels upon entering a portal is optimism. They are introduced to a beautiful and novel problem and learn that they can solve it.

I was looking for portals. I wanted to find and solve interesting problems, but there was no fun and easy way to do this. [^1]

How much fun it would be to identify where existing explanations were inadequate and create new ones! How much progress could be unleashed if problem solving was freed from the gatekeeping, bureaucracy, and inertia that currently impinges on it!

## No Ads or Paywalls

Ads and paywalls are bad solutions to the problem of monetization. I think it's wrong to make people pay to receive or create knowledge. As a college student, I probably wouldn't be able to afford PopperPlay myself if it was paywalled.

Advertisements are perhaps even worse. They create an incentive to optimize for click-bait and distraction, and they destroy the user experience (who, after all, hasn't cringed when an article they were reading was replaced with popups and banners)

But as PopperPlay grows, I will need money and to pay for servers and to support the time I am spending in building features and improving the site. I need your ideas about [how I should monetize](https://popperplay.com/problem/Ri7rf6GspvuCuuVL1274).

## Peer to Peer Donations

I am currently considering something like the Patreon model, where people can donate to those they think are solving interesting problems, and PopperPlay takes a percentage of each donation. We can avoid ads and paywalls, and PopperPlay's incentives would align with the benefit of problem solvers.

Most importantly, we can help people escape from existing sense-making institution. People will be able to sustain a life of creating knowledge. Creativity and fun no longer need to be shackled by problems like day jobs, gatekeeping, and bureaucracy.

## Popper's Criterion

> SOCRATES: I see. I have no need to trust the source if the argument itself is persuasive. And no way of using any source unless I also have a persuasive argument.
>
> David Deutsch, from _A Dream of Socrates_ in _The Beginning of Infinity_ [^1]

News, academia, and social media are in crisis. They are turning dogmatic, dishonest, and tribal. The source of this trouble is that we have been using the wrong criterion to judge institutions which help create knowledge. The prevailing approach focuses on sources, asking, "Who should we trust?" [^2]

This question is based on the same mistakes as the prevailing question in political philosophy, "Who should rule?". The philosopher Karl Popper pointed out that that since all rulers are fallible, and since they will all make mistakes, we will never find the perfect ruler who, once appointed, will dissolve problems once and for all. Similarly, there is no source of information which is free from error and bias. If we believe that we found such a source, then we become prone to believe incredulous claims which could not survive open criticism. Furthermore, there is no rational way to resolve disputes between sources claiming to justify their own credibility. Instead, disagreements must be settled by irrational appeals to authority (failing that, violence).

When we ask, "Who should we trust?", we are expecting explanationless progress. We are trying to predict future success from raw data like the qualifications and track record of news organizations and academic journals. But this is not an explanation for why we should expect progress to continue.

The only rational way to create progress is to satisfy Popper's criterion. The criterion which Karl Popper created to judge political institutions is equally applicable to platforms of knowledge creation: _Does the system facilitate the correction of errors and the creation of new ideas using reason and persuasion?_

Instead of seeking higher authorities of knowledge, we can build a platform which creates progress by encouraging problem solving, idea generation, and the criticism of prevailing conjectures. And we can subject our platform to error correction so that we can improve the structure of problem solving itself.

## Error Correction

PopperPlay is inspired by the philosophy of critical rationalism, but countless errors have been made in instantiating this theory. These errors will be found in the layout and structure of the website, in missing features, in the algorithms for featuring problems and conjectures (once I build them), and even in the philosophy you are reading right now. These problems cannot be solved unless they are accessible by all to identify and conjectures solutions upon. That is why **PopperPlay is completely open source**. I need your [feedback](https://popperplay.com/feedback) in order to make this website a more fun and open forum for the creation of new ideas and correction of errors.

[^1]: As a college student, I realized that not only was I was I not solving problems, I wasn't even learning how to solve problems. Instead, I was learning how to pretend like I was solving an interesting problem creatively while being neither creative nor interested.
[^1]: I realize the irony of using a source to make this point. I'm not appealing to authority, only to good writing.
[^2]: From this are derived further bad questions like, "How do we ensure that our journalistic and academic classes are responsible and informed?", "Who should be allowed to participate in the process of sense making?", and "How should the gatekeepers be educated?"
